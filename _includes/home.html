<h2>Diversity and Inclusion in Database Conferences</h2>

<p align="justify">
  The Data Management community is committed to the promotion of diversity and inclusion in all aspects of our professional activities.
  We celebrate the diversity in our community and welcome everyone regardless of age, gender identity, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic background,
  country of origin, religion, sexual orientation, physical ability, education, and work experience. We also welcome people and opinions
  of all political persuasions, as long as they abide by the <a href=https://www.acm.org/about-acm/policy-against-harassment>ACM policy against harassment</a>.
  Our initiative coordinates D&I efforts across the data management community and includes this year’s D&I chairs of SIGMOD, VLDB, SoCC, EDBT, and ICDE.

<p id="mission">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<p align="justify">
  Make diversity and inclusion a first class citizen in our conferences.
  Establish a feedback loop to better understand our standing with respect to all underrepresented groups.
  Ultimately, guide our community to adopt a more inclusive mindset in general toward different individuals regardless of their age, gender, gender identity,
  race, cultural background, religion, physical and mental ability, sexual orientation, parental and marital status, etc. Discourage discriminatory behavior
  during events that cause certain groups to feel unwelcome. This initiative is in collaboration with DBCares at <a href=https://sigmod.org/sigmod-policies/dbcares-policy/>SIGMOD</a> and <a href=http://www.vldb.org/vldb_cares.html>VLDB</a> 
  following the <a href=https://www.acm.org/about-acm/policy-against-harassment>ACM policy against harassment</a> and processes for reporting unacceptable behavior.
